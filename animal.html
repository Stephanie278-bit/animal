          <p id="interesting-fact">Queen Elizabeth II has long been associated with
            Corgis. After a visit to Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath in 1933,
            Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made it well known to their family
            that they liked the Corgis owned by the Marquess.</p> </div>

          <p id="summary">Welsh Corgis come in two varieties: the Pembroke and
            the Cardigan. They were registered as one breed by the Kennel Club in
            the U.K. until 1934, although many breeders believe the two breeds
            developed separately. Both have similar heads, bodies, levels of
            intelligence and herding ability, but the Cardigan is slightly
            larger and heavier boned than the Pembroke.
